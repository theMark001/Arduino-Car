# The Bluetooth module HC-05 TTL is a wireless communication module designed for serial (UART) communication over Bluetooth. Here’s what each of the specifications means:

# Characteristics

1. IO Voltage: 3.3V
  - This is the logic voltage level for the module’s input and output (IO) pins, meaning it communicates at 3.3V.
  - This is important because if you connect it to a microcontroller that uses a higher logic level (like 5V), you may need a level shifter to avoid damaging the module.

2. Input Voltage: 3.3V to 6V
	•	This is the range of voltages the module needs for power (not to be confused with IO voltage).
	•	You can power the HC-05 module with any voltage between 3.3V and 6V, making it compatible with a wide range of battery options or microcontroller boards that output within this range.
